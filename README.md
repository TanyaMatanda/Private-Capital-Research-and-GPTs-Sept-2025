Notes on GPT artifacts
----------------------
Several PDFs are GPT one-page overviews (e.g., "Private Equity Audit & Risk Oversight GPT" and "Venture Governance Gpt Suite"). If you would like these produced as directories under gpts/ with README.md, prompts/, and examples/, I can create those using the content in the PDFs as starting points.

How you can help
-----------------
- Confirm which documents should be promoted into structured directories (e.g., move GPT one-pagers into gpts/ as working artifacts).
- Indicate if you want me to extract titles, summaries, and example prompts from the PDFs and create initial gpts/* directories.
